          "question": "How can I invest in Tizor?",
          "answer": "To invest in Tizor, you need to register on our platform and link a compatible wallet with USDT (Tether). Then, you can transfer funds and select a staking plan that fits your investment goals. Once your funds are in staking, they will begin to generate income according to our annual return projections."

At Tizor, the funds designated for staking are managed in cryptocurrency futures markets and Bitcoin mining operations, which help maximize profitability. Once the staking period ends, you can withdraw both the invested capital and the generated returns."
